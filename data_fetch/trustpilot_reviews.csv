We received first class customer service from the start in the showroom until the job was done.   The office staff and workers who delivered the tub were professional and courteous at each step of the job.  I was very impressed with the sales rep Luc who went beyond the norm.  He followed every step of the job keeping us informed.  Once the tub was delivered and set up Luc returned twice.  He responded to a text message concerning a question on the weekend outside of office hours and followed up with an in person visit to ensure the concern was satisfactorily resolved.

I've followed all the rules but Airbnb don't value their OGs users anymore.As a host  my listing is my home and I only open it up for bookings if I'm going to be away.I opened up my calendar in July but with a minimum night stay of 20 nights (I'll be away all of July and hoping for just 1 guest as I won't be available for another handover). However someone booked on June 29th for 4 nights  so into July and my minimum night term.At first Airbnb admitted a technical error but later came back to explain that this is possible. Nowhere is this guest booking loop hole explained  Airbnb still haven't been able to point this out.Alas  in the end Airbnb advised I cancel  so I trusted their guidance. BUT I've been fined £50 and now those dates into July are blocked!I feel completely gaslit and Airbnb are unwilling to fix.Their customer service team have all been extremely rude  don't listen and instead continuously speak over you. My little voice isn't going to change anything but they've forgotten their original values and lost all empathy.I'm onto alternatives platforms now.Furthermore  they've closed my case because I didn't answer their call at 3am!Date of experience: May 15  2024,1
AwfulThe place I was supposed to stay at found mold and cancelled my reservation. This kicks off a few issues. First this happened THE DAY BEFORE. If I tried to cancel that day for any reason I would have never seen a penny back. They do not care about you. Second  I have no way to let anyone know on the platform that this person did that to me with no warning and they are some five star super host according to airbnb. Third  the customer service was horrible. As they tried to “help” me find a new location they offered only condolences and that they would treat me like their own family. a $25 coupon off my next stay (as long as it cost more than the one cancelled of course) is a horrible way to treat your family. I booked months out in advance to keep from having to pay last minute prices  and waiting hours on the phone to find a place twice as far from where I needed to be was not acceptable.

Horrendous company As a superhost with Airbnb for the last 2 years I have to say that they are absolutely horrendous to deal with. This latest 'verify your listing' is one of the most ill thought out things I have ever experienced. They want me to go into the holiday lodges I own and manage and take videos/photos of inside and outside - even if there are guests in. The customer service teams are absolutely hopeless and are robotic in their answers with no flexibility whatsoever. I have over 2 years of bookings and reviews with all 7 of the listings  and all of them have 5 star reviews. They are in in rural Scotland and I have completed over 300 guest nights with Abnb and significantly more with B.com  but I now have to do a near 600 mile round trip to photograph/video their authenticity and verify they are what they are. Even if guests are in  I have to photograph/video the inside  this intrusion on guests is completely unacceptable.They have blocked all dates out until the verification process has been done  despite them telling me I have until June 21st to complete the verification process. Truly horrendous customer service and a ridiculously ill thought out process for verification.Date of experience: May 16  2024,1

Noise is not a hazardI booked an apartment in Pavia Italy in the city center choosing based on distance to the University and conveniency (shopping  food). In my request I clearly stated that I'm coming to work.From the third night I encountered impossible noise of parties and drunken behavior which lasted until 3 sometimes 4 in the morning. It did not help to close all windows and use earplugs. After four nights of constant noise I asked to cancel the booking and get a refund while booking a different place in which I can sleep quietly. Apparently Airbnb cover only hazards that can be viewed. Noise in not such a hazard and so I was declined. Needless to say I paid double the amount to cover for the second part of my stay. I was using Airbnb for several years now. I will probably refrain from using them again and also recommend my colleagues to avoid this.  Date of experience: May 11  2024,1
AVOID AT ALL COSTI booked and payed an apartment in Annecy  France and yesterday the host sent me a message cancelling my staying pretending that his niece is going to be staying at the apartment ha ha ha....Without been big headed i am very proud of my Airbnb score which is 5 of 5 through the years so i call Airbnb and want a refund so i can use Booking.Com instead   and been told to wait 15 DAYS to get my refund.Why 15 days? It's their policy their rules to illegally make profit even if you didn't get the service refunds are issued to hundred of thousands of people and therefore making millions of profits with money deposited in their banks.It is called LEGALISED THEFT.They should punish hosts who just cancel booking because their niece or lover wanted the place (stupid excuses really) An advice to guests who booked in France  because of this year Olympics there will be thousands of canceling places because prices are quadruple today and that's what's happened to me.R.I.P.

Watch out for over billing!Air bnb debited my account with repetitive charges and stopped only when my bank stopped them by declining my card. They took over U$ 3800 out for a what would have been a 120/night stay. On top of that they charge 198 for cleaning then complain if you don't clean up and do the laundry. I am still trying to get the money back. Date of experience: April 23  2024,1
Stay cancelled one day prior to arrival We booked a stay for may 17-20 2024 in november 2023  and one day prior to arrival our stay is cancelled. We were not able to get a hold of the host until she messages back one day prior to arrival  and says that she closed the place in 2023 so it shouldn't be possible for us to have a reservation. Surely we booked our stay in 2023 when it was still on the market  but we booked for 2024 so someone should have informed us as soon as the stay was taken down from the site  or it shouldn't even have been possible for us to book it in the first place  but instead we find out one day before our trip. Airbnb refunds over money and gives us a coupon worth 170 DKK (25§)  so we can book somewhere new. However all there the stays that are left cost as much for one night  as we originally paid for 3 night. So much more expensive and also everything in the area is sold out due to high demand because of a concert. I try to call airbnb to get a bigger refund but i'm only able to get one more coupon with the same amount of money. Getting a coupon means I have to rent another airbnb and can't book somewhere else if I want to use the extra money. And even if i wanted another airbnb it wouldn't be nearly enough to cover the additional price.. However I was able to change the expiration date of the coupon so I would have 1 year to use them instead of 1 month  which was nice. Date of experience: May 16  2024,2

Most Insufferable Company Ive never been treated worse by a company. We were left completely helpless over 5000 miles away from home. The host  Zeb  from Czech Republic gave us aimless directions  and took us over 30 minutes to find the home. After a pointless  unhelpful conversation with the host  we hoped to get some help from AirBnB. Instead we were left with  "sorry  theres no violation here  theres nothing we can do." After our host didn't bother to recognize the fact we had no idea where we were  and no navigable instructions were given  we decided not to stay. We also felt entirely unsafe in the area  as there was $4000 worth of camera equipment. The door also wouldn't close properly. It was a run down  shady apartment. The host continued to argue with us  and airbnb left us in the dark with no where to go. Luckily we found accommodations in a hotel across town. I have proceeded with litigation towards airbnb  as they continue to hold over 1000$ of my money. Companies that treat a loyal customer of over 9 years this way should be out of business. Not to mention the cultural gentrification that leaves citizens without a place to live  and causes over tourism. Due to Airbnbs inconvenience of myself and societies around the globe  I will aim to bankrupt this awful  despicable entity. Date of experience: May 05  2024,1
Airbnb Unresolution CentreWe stayed 3 nights at a property  which was all good until we checked out and there was a claim from them for damage. We disagreed with the story provided by the hosts so we declined the claim as we felt it was inaccurate and the costs they were claiming were ridiculous. But that was not actually the issue ….We had now entered the Resolution Centre labyrinth  a brilliant Airbnb invention of befuddlement and stonewalling  an aimless dance where you never get a straight answer  you get passed around  hit silent dead ends  days and weeks slip by with no responses  the promised “referrals to the specialists” and phone callbacks never eventuate  you are lied to in order to fob you off another few days  the chats you had open get arbitrarily closed etc.  And then they take your money anyway. In a nutshell.  There is no resolution centre  it is a unresolution centre  designed to frustrate until you give up. And that is why  sigh  I have cancelled my Airbnb account.

I have a lovely requester who I would love to give my flat to  but there is another requester who keeps coming back quicker and I have no control over that. And if I canceled this requester I will be charged. SERIOUSLY. Your booking system sucks.Date of experience: May 15  2024,1
Claim host approved even though its…Claim host approved even though its clear the coach is different than the coach advertised with and in my goodbye video. Also scientific proof not read neither the conversation in the app itself. The host knows rules when it comes to odour clause which enables to make claim.Odour can not be proven on video yet. If that can be invented than we guests would stand stronger. I now did it with local market research  appointing communication via Airbnb app. Date of experience: May 05  2024,1
RUDE AND SELFISH MEMBERS!I cannot believe the conduct of AIRBNB member's and how rude and selfish they are!I cannot understand why they think they are so above everyone when in actual fact they are just below!We received a booking of which we honored but what got me was that their friends rented equipment from another company but still thought it was alright to use our facilities.A bit like taking Mc Donalds into a restuarant and eating on their tables.Then they gave us a bad review honestly AIRBNB members are just super stingy and selfish!We will be leaving AIRBNB it has become a pool of very greedy people who don't want to pay for anything.But wants a 5 star gold service.Date of experience: May 11  2024,1
Stick to hotelsStick to hotels. This is my first experience (TERRIBLE) and it will be my last one. I am still trying to get help from an airbnb agent and they are taking forever to respond. I am an honest and fair person. Do not use airbnb platform. Hotels are much better. I will update with more details once they "resolve" the issue or if they don't. Date of experience: May 14  2024,1
No customer service No customer service I listed my property on AirBnB  and they suspended my account without notifying for over a month now. I have contacted they numerous time  but there is no answer. It is an absolute time wasterDate of experience: May 15  2024,1

I've followed all the rules but Airbnb don't value their OGs users anymore.As a host  my listing is my home and I only open it up for bookings if I'm going to be away.I opened up my calendar in July but with a minimum night stay of 20 nights (I'll be away all of July and hoping for just 1 guest as I won't be available for another handover). However someone booked on June 29th for 4 nights  so into July and my minimum night term.At first Airbnb admitted a technical error but later came back to explain that this is possible. Nowhere is this guest booking loop hole explained  Airbnb still haven't been able to point this out.Alas  in the end Airbnb advised I cancel  so I trusted their guidance. BUT I've been fined £50 and now those dates into July are blocked!I feel completely gaslit and Airbnb are unwilling to fix.Their customer service team have all been extremely rude  don't listen and instead continuously speak over you. My little voice isn't going to change anything but they've forgotten their original values and lost all empathy.I'm onto alternatives platforms now.Furthermore  they've closed my case because I didn't answer their call at 3am!Date of experience: May 15  2024,1
Horrendous company As a superhost with Airbnb for the last 2 years I have to say that they are absolutely horrendous to deal with. This latest 'verify your listing' is one of the most ill thought out things I have ever experienced. They want me to go into the holiday lodges I own and manage and take videos/photos of inside and outside - even if there are guests in. The customer service teams are absolutely hopeless and are robotic in their answers with no flexibility whatsoever. I have over 2 years of bookings and reviews with all 7 of the listings  and all of them have 5 star reviews. They are in in rural Scotland and I have completed over 300 guest nights with Abnb and significantly more with B.com  but I now have to do a near 600 mile round trip to photograph/video their authenticity and verify they are what they are. Even if guests are in  I have to photograph/video the inside  this intrusion on guests is completely unacceptable.They have blocked all dates out until the verification process has been done  despite them telling me I have until June 21st to complete the verification process. Truly horrendous customer service and a ridiculously ill thought out process for verification.Date of experience: May 16  2024,1
Took our money and then declinedMade a reservation and paid half of the amount. Airbnb took the money from our account and then declined us. Called Airbnb and spoke to them many times and they could not give me the reason why! So I had to call and talk with my bank  so much extra job and time on the phone. Then we tried one more time  with another house to rent  with Airbnb and the same thing happened again! They could not help us again. Now we have to wait to get our money back for 2 weeks. So bye bye Airbnb  I'm taking away my account today. Date of experience: May 14  2024,1
Noise is not a hazardI booked an apartment in Pavia Italy in the city center choosing based on distance to the University and conveniency (shopping  food). In my request I clearly stated that I'm coming to work.From the third night I encountered impossible noise of parties and drunken behavior which lasted until 3 sometimes 4 in the morning. It did not help to close all windows and use earplugs. After four nights of constant noise I asked to cancel the booking and get a refund while booking a different place in which I can sleep quietly. Apparently Airbnb cover only hazards that can be viewed. Noise in not such a hazard and so I was declined. Needless to say I paid double the amount to cover for the second part of my stay. I was using Airbnb for several years now. I will probably refrain from using them again and also recommend my colleagues to avoid this.  Date of experience: May 11  2024,1
AwfulThe place I was supposed to stay at found mold and cancelled my reservation. This kicks off a few issues. First this happened THE DAY BEFORE. If I tried to cancel that day for any reason I would have never seen a penny back. They do not care about you. Second  I have no way to let anyone know on the platform that this person did that to me with no warning and they are some five star super host according to airbnb. Third  the customer service was horrible. As they tried to “help” me find a new location they offered only condolences and that they would treat me like their own family. a $25 coupon off my next stay (as long as it cost more than the one cancelled of course) is a horrible way to treat your family. I booked months out in advance to keep from having to pay last minute prices  and waiting hours on the phone to find a place twice as far from where I needed to be was not acceptable.

AVOID AT ALL COSTI booked and payed an apartment in Annecy  France and yesterday the host sent me a message cancelling my staying pretending that his niece is going to be staying at the apartment ha ha ha....Without been big headed i am very proud of my Airbnb score which is 5 of 5 through the years so i call Airbnb and want a refund so i can use Booking.Com instead   and been told to wait 15 DAYS to get my refund.Why 15 days? It's their policy their rules to illegally make profit even if you didn't get the service refunds are issued to hundred of thousands of people and therefore making millions of profits with money deposited in their banks.It is called LEGALISED THEFT.They should punish hosts who just cancel booking because their niece or lover wanted the place (stupid excuses really) An advice to guests who booked in France  because of this year Olympics there will be thousands of canceling places because prices are quadruple today and that's what's happened to me.R.I.P.

I am a host but am currently removing my listingI am a host and the speed with which Airbnb look to penalise or charge fees is frightening. I am currently removing the listing as there are plenty of alternative providers out there. It seems a strange business model to mess your hosts around in the way Airbnb do frequently.Date of experience: May 11  2024,1
Watch out for over billing!Air bnb debited my account with repetitive charges and stopped only when my bank stopped them by declining my card. They took over U$ 3800 out for a what would have been a 120/night stay. On top of that they charge 198 for cleaning then complain if you don't clean up and do the laundry. I am still trying to get the money back. Date of experience: April 23  2024,1
Unlike many people I seem to have had positive dealings with AirbnbUnlike many people I seem to have had positive dealings with Airbnb - I recently had an issue with a company (on behalf of a host) and they resolved the problem quickly.So far all listings I have visited have been exactly as stated with good service. Fees sometimes seem a little over the top though  and the listed nightly price doesn't actually end up being an indication of total cost  so searching for a decent priced place can take a long time.

Most Insufferable Company Ive never been treated worse by a company. We were left completely helpless over 5000 miles away from home. The host  Zeb  from Czech Republic gave us aimless directions  and took us over 30 minutes to find the home. After a pointless  unhelpful conversation with the host  we hoped to get some help from AirBnB. Instead we were left with  "sorry  theres no violation here  theres nothing we can do." After our host didn't bother to recognize the fact we had no idea where we were  and no navigable instructions were given  we decided not to stay. We also felt entirely unsafe in the area  as there was $4000 worth of camera equipment. The door also wouldn't close properly. It was a run down  shady apartment. The host continued to argue with us  and airbnb left us in the dark with no where to go. Luckily we found accommodations in a hotel across town. I have proceeded with litigation towards airbnb  as they continue to hold over 1000$ of my money. Companies that treat a loyal customer of over 9 years this way should be out of business. Not to mention the cultural gentrification that leaves citizens without a place to live  and causes over tourism. Due to Airbnbs inconvenience of myself and societies around the globe  I will aim to bankrupt this awful  despicable entity. Date of experience: May 05  2024,1
Airbnb Unresolution CentreWe stayed 3 nights at a property  which was all good until we checked out and there was a claim from them for damage. We disagreed with the story provided by the hosts so we declined the claim as we felt it was inaccurate and the costs they were claiming were ridiculous. But that was not actually the issue ….We had now entered the Resolution Centre labyrinth  a brilliant Airbnb invention of befuddlement and stonewalling  an aimless dance where you never get a straight answer  you get passed around  hit silent dead ends  days and weeks slip by with no responses  the promised “referrals to the specialists” and phone callbacks never eventuate  you are lied to in order to fob you off another few days  the chats you had open get arbitrarily closed etc.  And then they take your money anyway. In a nutshell.  There is no resolution centre  it is a unresolution centre  designed to frustrate until you give up. And that is why  sigh  I have cancelled my Airbnb account.
